# TerraFERMA CIDER tutorials docker image

Welcome to TerraFERMA (CIDER tutorials)!

This docker image contains a complete installation of TerraFERMA and its dependencies, PETSc, FEniCS and SPuD, within an Ubuntu
16.04LTS OS.

The environment variables have been set automatically using environment modules and it should now be possible to build and run
TerraFERMA models within this container.  Opening the diamond GUI (and other visualization tools) depends on having forwarded the
X11 connection correctly from this docker container to the local machine.  Additionally the `shared` directory is available to use 
as shared volume with the local machine but depends on the correct configuration being used at startup.

The folder `cider_tutorials` contains several example simulations for this tutorial.  Full instructions on how to run these can be 
found in the `README.md` file in that folder but in general you should use the `tfsimulationharness` command.  For example, to run
the simple Poisson heat distribution example run:

    cd cider_tutorials
    tfsimulationharness --test poisson_simple.shml

The folder `cider_tutorials.examples` contains a suite of pre-run example simulations across a range of parameters (also documented
in the `README.md` file in that folder).  To view the pre-prepared output you should use the `tfsimulationharness` command with the
`--just-test` tag instead of `--test` above.  For example:

    cd cider_tutorials.examples
    tfsimulationharness --just-test poisson_simple.shml

Additionally, the folders `tests` and `tutorials` contain links to more general testing and tutorial suites for TerraFERMA.  
Additional input files can be downloaded directly to this container or shared via the local machine.  For example, the benchmarking 
suite can be obtained from the TerraFERMA github repositories.
